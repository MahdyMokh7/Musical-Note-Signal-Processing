# Musical-Note-Signal-Processing

## SignalNote

**SignalNote** is a Python-based academic project developed for the *Signals and Systems* final course (Fall 1403–1404).  
The project focuses on generating, optimizing, and analyzing musical notes using digital signal processing techniques.

It simulates the synthesis of piano-like tones using sine waves, applies harmonic smoothing, and evaluates the resulting waveforms.  
The final stage includes an attempt to predict note sequences from audio inputs using signal reconstruction methods.
